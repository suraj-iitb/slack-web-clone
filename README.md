# slack-web-clone

This project is designed to emulate the Slack collaboration software. Just like Slack,
this application contains the concept of workspaces and channels to manage teams and
projects. Workspace is at the top level of the hierarchy and can be used for entire
Projects. Channels are the second level of hierarchy which can be used to separate
different teams like development, testing, etc. For a user, there can be many workspaces
and in a workspace, there can be many channels.
